        <h3>Flexbox</h3>
        <p class="text-left"> Is powerful, but confusing. If you're tired of trying to figure out container flex directions vs item alignments vs item justifications, this framework is for you.</p>

        <p class="text-left"> Use <code>inner-</code> helpers to cascade margin, padding, outlines, shadows, and other traits in a clean, standardized fashion.</p>

        <p class="text-left">Emdash color classes consider both background <i>and</i> font colors together, for legibility. Don't love the defaults? Updating the <code>:root</code> variables takes seconds.</p>
