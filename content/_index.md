# Emdash CSS

EmdashCSS aims to be a lightweight and fun CSS framework by using a **behaviorally driven syntax** that eliminates any confusion of flexbox properties. 

## What does that mean? 

- You can shape your elements using containers called **spreads** ↔️ and **stacks** ↕️.
- You can cascade behaviors such as **spacing**, **size**, **fit**, **darkness**, **brightness**, and **roundness**.
